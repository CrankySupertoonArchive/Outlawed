All templates created and developed by Gillymoth aka Ign: lafuller 2015-2018
This set is for any version from 1.9 to 1.12

-------

use these tips when installing Ruins mod to confirm proper installation

    If Ruins is installed:
    breaking a block holding a stick will show the block-name in chat


Gillymoth Diagnostic Tip #2856 (page 143 of Ruins Forum)
    (refined from gillymoth tips #2773 and #2775 from page 138)

    typing "/testruin tester" in the chat will do one of 4 things:

    unknown command <-- the code for ruins is not installed in game
    do not have permission <-- retest in creative mode, set in LAN or use creative test world
    filepath does not exist <-- the folder structure needs to be in place (or just missing the test file)
    a pile of blocks spawns around you <-- success!

===================================================================

   Folders that haven't been listed contain proxy templates to spawn the above structures.
   Extra folders added as a safeguard in case this is run in the version with broken internal biome lists.

==================================================


   This set is updated often, focusing on a few aspects of Facility/Settlement/Civilization for each update.

   This set has evolved over a long time, and builds are being constantly revised and renovated.
   If a build from the most recent set is no longer available, links to all the previous versions
   are still intact, and obsolete structures can be replaced, however they are likely to have been
   rebuilt from scratch for newer sets.


   If any structures become broken in some way, they can be moved to the top of the list for renovations.


  -------------  Update News  -----------

   A hunter tribe has settled in the savanna to explore natural resources.

   Plains civilization hires lumberjacks to clean house, improves cities and farms, and moves into forests.
  Miners move into Extrme Hills.

   Hayfever increases as spores spread on the wind.

   A natural wonder has been discovered across all biomes.

  too tired to type, must sleep.
